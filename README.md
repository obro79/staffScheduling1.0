# My Personal Project

## Staff Scheduler (Catered towards Resturants)

A *bulleted* list:

- I will be designing a staff scheduling software. The 'manager' will be able to enter a list of employees where each
employee has different attributes like occupation, name, availibility, days off, as well as preferred hours. 
It also allows the manager to decide how many people they want working at a time. 
software will take all these parameters into consideration and make a schedule that fits these criteria. If no schedule 
can be made it will give a message saying why it's impossible like "No one put availibilty for Mondays."

- The users will be managers of different workplacs that wants to schedule their employees automatically so they can
free up time doing more important things

- I'm want to do this project because I feel like this matches the project description closely as well as this will an
ineffiency in my workplace and give me practice finding a good algorithm so that this can scale decently well when
adding more employees.

- As a user i want to be able to add an arbitrary number of employees to my list
- as a user i want to be able to specify the job that the employee has 
- as a user i want to be able to specify the times that i need employees
- as a user i want to be able to specify the number of employees that i need at a time
