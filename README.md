# My Personal Project

## Poker Trainer

A *bulleted* list:
- It will be a graphical user interface that will show the user their 2 playing cards and ask if they should raise,
fold, or call. After the user makes a decision it will give feedback on whether it was the best play, okay play or
terrible play. The user will also be able to change their 'table position' and practice making their decisions from 
different position because being in different positions changes which hands the user should play. It will also allow the
user to star the hands that they keep getting wrong so they can focus on the hands they find the most difficult. 
- The users will be people that are interested in improving their poker skills 

- I'm want to get better at poker and the existing poker training apps don't have the exact functionality that I want or
they cost too much money. This project will also allow me to apply the probability knowledge that I have been learning
in my other math classes.
