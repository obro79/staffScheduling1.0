# My Personal Project

## Staff Scheduler (Catered towards Resturants)

A *bulleted* list:

- I will be designing a staff scheduling software. The 'manager' will be able to enter a list of employees where each
employee has different attributes like occupation, name, availibility, days off, as well as preferred hours. 
It also allows the manager to decide how many people they want working at a time. 
software will take all these parameters into consideration and make a schedule that fits these criteria. If no schedule 
can be made it will give a message saying why it's impossible like "No one put availibilty for Mondays."

- The users will be managers of different workplacs that wants to schedule their employees automatically so they can
free up time doing more important things

- I'm want to do this project because I feel like this matches the project description closely as well as this will an
ineffiency in my workplace and give me practice finding a good algorithm so that this can scale decently well when
adding more employees.

- As a user, I want to be able to create a new employee and add it to a list of employees
- As a user, I want to be able to select a employee and add a update their availability player to the team
- As a user, I want to be able to select a employee and view their weekly availability {list of availabilities}
- As a user, I want to specify and confirm the number of employees I need at a time. 
{List of Number of Employees Needed}.
